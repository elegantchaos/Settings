import Foundation

/// Settings that live in memory, isolated to one test.
///
/// A real suite leaves a preferences file behind once anything is written to it, and
/// `removePersistentDomain(forName:)` only empties that file. Keeping the values out of the
/// preferences system is the only way for a test to leave nothing behind.
///
/// Reading and writing values, registering defaults, and `dictionaryRepresentation()` all
/// stay in memory. SwiftUI's `@AppStorage` reads and writes these values when given the
/// instance as its store.
///
/// It differs from a real `UserDefaults` in these ways:
///
/// - Registered defaults belong to the instance. A real registration domain is shared by
///   the whole process.
/// - Nothing else is in the search list, so `dictionaryRepresentation()` holds only the
///   stored and registered values, and the global and argument domains are not read.
/// - Changes send no key-value observation notifications, so nothing that observes the
///   settings, including a live view, is told about them.
/// - The domain and suite methods, such as `setPersistentDomain(_:forName:)` and
///   `addSuite(named:)`, are inherited unchanged and act on the real preferences system.
///
/// Tests that need any of that should use ``persistentSuite(prefix:)`` instead.
